# Neural-Network-Assignment

Two tasks in assignment require us to implement multilayer perceptron and backward propagation from scratch. (using numpy instead of tensorflow)

It's really a meaningful and rewarding assignment, enabling me to have an intuitive and clear understanding of what's happening inside neural network. So I uploaded it here to keep it in record.
